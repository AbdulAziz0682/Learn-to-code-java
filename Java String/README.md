# Java String

__String__ is an important class in java used to store a sequence of characters.

We can define a string object using the following syntax in java :

``
String stringObject = "hello";
``

Here `stringObject` is the variable name which stores `hello`.  

We have a number of operations supported for Strings like toLower(), subString(), concat(), length(), etc.
