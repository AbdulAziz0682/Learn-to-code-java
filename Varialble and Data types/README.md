# Variable and Data types
Variable

A variable is memory location that holds data. data can be changed
You can make a variable by using letter,numbers,hyphens,dollarsign but should begin with a letter  

Data types mean type of data 


There are two type of data types

1) Primative Datatypes
2)Non-primative Datatypes

Primative datatypes:

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

byte	 1 byte		    Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	 2 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int		 4 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	 8 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	 4 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	 8 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	 1 bit		    Stores true or false values
char	 2 bytes			Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values



Non-Primitive Datatypes


Non-Primitive data types refer to objects and hence they are called reference types. 
Examples of non-primitive types include Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface.



WHY WE USE VARIABLES AND DATATYPES
 enable programmers to write flexible programs. Rather than entering data directly into a program,by storing data in variable you can reuse  it will take occupy less memory and datatype help in order to understand the type of data.
